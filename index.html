ACP program participants are eligible to participate in the new federal government funded Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP). The SWA Connect FREE ACP plan includes up to 10 GB of 5G/4G High Speed Data. To Opt-IN to this ACP plan, please read the following and OPT-IN below. The ACP is a program operated by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) that provides discounts on monthly broadband Internet access service and certain connected devices. The ACP monthly service and device discounts are non-transferrable. An eligible household is limited to one monthly service discount and one device discount. ACP Program benefits may be obtained from any participating provider of your choosing and your monthly service benefit may be transferred to another provider at any time.
If/when the FCC announces the end of the ACP program or we end our promotional FREE ACP service offer, we will notify you and you will revert to receiving only the standard FREE ACP plan where available and if you are eligible. You may keep your ACP service by paying the applicable undiscounted rate of $40.00 plus fees and taxes. Our standard terms and conditions apply.
I understand that ACP benefits are limited to one per household. If I am found to already be receiving an ACP discount benefit from another provider, I understand my current benefit will be transferred to SWA Connect. I consent to the transfer of my ACP discount benefit from my current ACP provider to SWA Connect.
